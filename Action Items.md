Musts:

* Power-ups (the freeze alien power-up should also make the aliens not fire and the red powerup of pierce makes the ball go through the walls)

* Replace basic bar and squares with the actual ship and alien looks
* when game is over, the Game Over screen appears with the score and high score displayed. make it look nice.

* sound effects for when ball hits alien
* sound effects for when ball hits player
* sound effects for level cleared or game over
* when power ups are active, some graphic should indicate that. (Freeze, aliens are frozen. Immunity, the player has a shield. Pierce, the ball has a unique graphic)
* The player dying or missing the ball subtracts from the score by 100 and 10 respectively.
* Keep track of level and display it



Wants:

* animations when player ship is destroyed
* animations when alien gets destroyed



Bugs:

* If the aliens are frozen and they all get killed during frozen period, the level will not clear until the freeze is over.
